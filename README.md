## Generating and Viewing Documentation

Documentation for this project is generated using the Dokka tool. 
To generate the documentation again, run the following command in the terminal in the root directory of your project:

```bash
./gradlew dokkaHtml
```

After running this command, open the `index.html` file located in the `build/dokka/html` folder in your web browser to view the generated documentation.
